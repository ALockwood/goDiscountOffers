# goDiscountOffers
A "learn along the way" port of my DiscountOffers C# solution to Go. 

Once this is running I'm going to try to make some mock data with bad values to see how the different languages handle things and to learn a bit more about 
how to program defensively in go.

## Running
On Windows I use PowerShell and my go utils so it's simply `GoBuildNRun` in the checked out directory.
Otherwise...   
1. Build `github.com\alockwood\goDiscountOffers`
2. Run ` .\goDiscountOffers.exe .\InputSample\InputSample.txt`
